    be affected by every penny taxed or saved. I saw the
    effects of insufficient and even bad advice. I know how
    every dollar earned or taken away affects business, and
    most importantly, family. It’s not just dollars, it’s time
    and opportunity—time you took away from your family so
    those dollars earned could provide better opportunities
    for them. I care too much because I know you do, too.`,

      and to never take myself too seriously. I will tell you what I
      can and what I cannot do for you. I will dig deeper than any
      of my adversaries to find the answers you need. And if you
      make me laugh while sharing a beer together after a long day,
      it will likely come out of my nose.`,
