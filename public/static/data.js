      bio: `I was taught to be vigorously honest, endlessly curious, 
      and immensely resourceful. I will earnestly tell you what I can 
      and cannot do for you, without pretense. If I cannot do it, I will 
      find someone I trust who can. No stone will go unturned to find the 
      answers you need or the solution that best fits your personal situation. 
      Making a difference for people is not what I do, it is who I am.`,

      bio: `I care too much. I watched my dad, a small business owner, 
      affected by every penny taxed or saved. I saw the
      effects of insufficient and even bad advice. I know how
      every dollar earned or taken away affects business, and
      most importantly, family. It’s not just dollars, it’s time
      and opportunity—time you took away from your family so
      those dollars earned could provide better opportunities
      for them. I care too much because I know you do, too.`,

      bio: `I seek to always act with purity of intention and a quality of being 
      rooted in truthfulness, accountability and commitment to the betterment of others. 
      I use my psychology background to represent you in a manner that aligns with these 
      principles. I will respect your time and conserve your resources. Our shared goal: 
      to resolve disputes, not contentiously litigate.`,
